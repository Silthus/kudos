// The service's in-process test backend, what today's `testing/slackBackend.ts` gives Convex's tests: the operation
// runner wired to the registry's bus subscribers, a worker that runs due jobs and crons on the app's clock through
// AppTime, the seeder, the Slack and PostHog fakes behind `fetch`, signed Slack requests through the front door, the
// domain events that committed operations published, and live views woken by the process's listener, as the service's.
// One per test, on the worker's schema:
//
//   const backend = useTestBackend();
//   test("...", async () => {
//     const t = backend();
//     await t.event({ type: "message", ... });
//     await t.settle();
//     expect(t.slack.messagesIn("C_GENERAL")).toEqual(...);
//   });
