// The three kinds of operation the app has, run by one runner:
// - a mutation: one SERIALIZABLE transaction, re-run whole on a serialization failure or a deadlock, with one `now`
//   read before the first attempt and kept across every retry;
// - a query: one REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY transaction, so every read sees one snapshot, with one `now`;
// - an action: no transaction; it reads the clock live and runs mutations and queries through the runner.
// A mutation that wrote a table some website view shows wakes the live views when it commits (live.ts).
// A mutation or query never runs another: the inner one would commit on its own, outside the outer's transaction.
// The transaction is the runner's: a handler can't begin, commit or roll it back, only use savepoints inside it.
// A failure is logged with the operation's name; never its message, which may quote SQL.
// A mutation or query never reaches the network either: it may run again, and it holds its transaction while it waits.
// Any fetch or http(s) request made while one runs throws, and fails the operation even when its handler catches it,
// unless it ran behind the operation's one `fence`, which undoes everything behind it and lets the operation go on.
