// Quests' one next quest and the week's two quests, ported from convex/quests/next.test.ts over the service's operations.
// Kudos and hugs reach Quests as today's kudosGiven and hugGiven events, which the worker hands to the quests
// registration's subscribers, and the hourly sweep draws the week's side quests. The reads are today's nextQuestOf and
// twoQuestsOf, at the operation's clock. Today's file reads the two quests through the website's quests read, which is
// S17's: its rows are asserted here on twoQuestsOf, and the website's own fields (hint, item, drawn) wait on S17.
// The one body still stubbed on main the tests reach, welcome's isWelcomed, is stood in over the rows the tests write,
// as today's code reads it; S6's xp-levels decision and S5's republish run as main has them.
