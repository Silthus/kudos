// The website's API over HTTP: `POST /api/query/<name>` runs a read and `POST /api/mutation/<name>` a command of the
// route table, each in one operation of its own, with the arguments its zod schema passed. The answer is the route's
// result as JSON, a denial included; anything else is an error status with a short reason and no detail.
//
// A request must be JSON and carry the API's own header. A cross-site page can send neither without the browser asking
// first (a CORS preflight), which the service never grants, so no form or link on another site runs a command.
//
// `GET /api/live` is a member's stream of invalidations (liveStream.ts), which the website follows to refetch what its
// open views hold. The browser's EventSource sends no header of the API's, so it is refused only when cross-site; it
// reads nothing but who may follow, and answers a denial as a read does.
