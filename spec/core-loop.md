# Spec: the new core loop: items, XP moments and social pull

> **Accepted on Silthus/personal#101 (2026-10-21): the product owner locked the spec and its two test seams and asked for it to be built and deployed autonomously. Its 17 implementation tickets are Silthus/personal#103 to Silthus/personal#119.** This file lives on the integration branch `spec/core-loop` and is never merged on its own: each implementation ticket lands its slice on this branch, and the ship ticket takes it to `main`. It is the spec of the core-loop map (Silthus/personal#95).
>
> **Rule numbers.** Rules are cited as `LP1`–`LP103`. Album rules keep their own numbers (`AL8`, `AL10`), as `convex/album/Album.spec.md` cites them.
>
> **Thirteen stopping points**, one flag each. 1 (LP1–LP25) is the item board behind `hidden-items`: the ledger, the board, the turn, the old flow going dark and the spoiler-free Slack reply. 2 (LP26–LP37, LP61) is the XP moment behind `xp-moments`, with its level-up takeover and the glow that starts it again. 3 (LP38–LP43) is the Slack teaser and the norm line behind `teasers`. 4 (LP44–LP50) is the welcome item and the welcome nudge behind `welcome-item`. 5 (LP51–LP56) is the share and the Monday post's find behind `item-share`. 6 (LP57–LP60) is the pet hoggie behind `pet-hoggie`. 7 (LP62–LP65), a follow-up from Silthus/personal#130, is the achievement hoggies behind `achievement-hoggies`. 8 (LP66–LP77), a follow-up from Silthus/personal#133, is the onboarding loop behind `onboarding`: the how-it-works card, the first-thanks top-up, the level-2 emoji, the first-hug reply, the emoji popup and `Getting started`. 9 (LP78–LP83), a follow-up from Silthus/personal#135, is the link previews behind `link-previews`: a person or team link unfolds in Slack, and their pages carry `Share`. 10 (LP84–LP88), a follow-up from Silthus/personal#145, is the rich link cards behind `rich-link-cards`: the card shows the level bar, the rarest hoggies and the stats a member can brag with. 11 (LP89–LP92), a follow-up from Silthus/personal#156, is the weekly highlights behind `weekly-highlights`: the Monday post quotes one top kudos and lists the week's top three new givers, the first with their card. 12 (LP93–LP98), a follow-up from Silthus/personal#161, is person page D behind `person-page-d`: one page for your own page and a teammate's. 13 (LP99–LP103), a follow-up from Silthus/personal#162, is the card picture behind `card-image`: a person link unfolds into a picture of their person page D card. 1 comes first; 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 build on it; 6 and 9 stand alone; 8 builds on 1, 2 and 4; 10 builds on 9; 11 reuses 10's card; 12 stands alone; 13 builds on 10 and draws 12's card.

Where an input conflicts with the product owner's own call, his call wins: earned emojis are never hidden and unlock with the turn that brings them, and there are no random emojis.

## Problem Statement

A member who is thanked, or who thanks a teammate thoughtfully, has to do three chores before they see what they earned: open a pack, find the sticker and the hoggie in the tray, and put each one into the album. The Slack reply spoils the surprise before the website gets a chance: it already says who the new sticker is, how far the page got and which emoji unlocked. When the member comes back to the website, nothing tells them what happened in Slack since they were last there. Slack itself says almost nothing that would pull them over: one button. A member who has been thanked but never opened the website gets no reason to. And a member who finds something rare has no way to show it.

A newcomer's first visit ends on one line about the next item, and nothing teaches the two Slack gestures that drive everything. Their first kudos pays 10 XP of the 20 that level 2 needs, so the first level-up waits for an item's turn on the website, and level 2 unlocks no emoji. A first hug answers nothing at all. The emoji popup lists only emojis the newcomer has not earned ("0 of 27") and never the kudos emoji they can already use.

## Solution

**Everything a member earned and has not seen lies face down on one board, and turning an item over is the reveal. Coming back plays what happened since the last visit, and Slack says just enough to make the member want to look.**

- **Items, face down.** Every reward a member has not seen (a thanked person's sticker, a pack's hoggie, a level-up's three hoggies, the welcome hoggie) is a round item, face down with a question mark, on one item board. A click cross-fades to the album page it belongs to, the item turns over, its rarity bursts out, and it lands in its slot with force. There are no packs to open and no tray to empty.
- **No spoilers.** Slack says `An item for thanking Alex · 3 wait`. Nothing anywhere says what an item holds before it turns.
- **The XP moment.** When a member comes back, what happened since the last visit flies out of a glowing orb as Slack-style excerpts. A click dissolves them into XP that fills the bar. A crossed level gets a gold takeover. Then the waiting items land face down on the same canvas.
- **Pull from Slack.** App Home and the Monday hugs recap carry a teaser ("3 items wait · 2 kudos came in since your last visit"), and the XP moment and App Home carry a norm line ("12 teammates gave thoughtful kudos this week").
- **Welcome.** A member who has never opened the website has one welcome item waiting, a hoggie that is at least rare, and gets exactly one DM, ever, after a kudos or hug they receive, inviting them to collect it.
- **Share and pet.** After a turn that finds an epic or legendary hoggie or completes a team page, the member may press `Share` to post the win to the weekly-post channel. A member may pick one hoggie they own as their pet, shown on their person page and beside their sticker on team pages.
- **Onboarding.** A newcomer's first visit ends on one how-it-works card that shows a hug and a kudos as they look in Slack. Their first kudos takes them straight to level 2, which unlocks `:raised_hands:`, a standard Slack emoji they can use at once. Their first hug gets one private reply. The emoji popup leads with what they can use now and what they unlock next, and `Getting started` on the profile walks the same loop.
- **Dark first.** Every piece ships behind its own sandbox-only flag in project 662840 and widens to production once its sandbox proof is green.

## User Stories

**The item board (stopping point 1)**

1. As a member, I want everything I earned and have not seen to wait face down on one board, so that I collect it in one place instead of opening packs and emptying a tray.
2. As a member, I want every waiting item to look the same from the back, so that nothing tells me what it holds before I turn it.
3. As a member, I want an item to lift, wiggle once and bob its question mark when I hover over it, so that the board feels alive without giving anything away.

23. As the product owner, I want every turn recorded in PostHog with its source and rarity, so that I can see whether the board is used.
24. As the product owner, I want the flag to go back off at any time without losing anything, so that a bad rollout is a two-way door.

25. As a returning member, I want what happened in Slack since my last visit to play as Slack-style excerpts, so that I feel the thanks I got and gave.
26. As a returning member, I want the excerpts to ring a mystery orb that reads "? XP", so that the total is a small surprise.

30. As a member who crossed a level, I want the level-up always among the five, so that it never hides in the fold.
31. As a member who crossed a level, I want a gold takeover that names the level and lists what it unlocked, staying until I click, so that the level-up is its own moment.

39. As a member who gets the Monday hugs recap, I want the same counts as its last line, so that the recap pulls me over too.
40. As a member, I want the teaser hidden when nothing waits and nothing came in, so that Slack stays quiet when there is nothing to say.
41. As a member, I want to see how many teammates gave thoughtful kudos this week, so that I feel part of a habit without anyone being ranked.
42. As a member who opted out of the boards, I want to be counted in the norm line but never named, so that my privacy holds.

**Welcome (stopping point 4)**

43. As a member who has never opened the website, I want one hoggie that is at least rare waiting for me, so that my first visit pays off.
44. As a member who was just thanked and has never opened the website, I want one DM that quotes the thanks and invites me to collect my rare hoggie, so that I learn HedgeHug exists for me.
45. As a member, I want that DM exactly once, ever, so that HedgeHug never nags me.
46. As a member who was hugged rather than thanked, I want the DM to link the hugged message, so that it still makes sense.
47. As a member who has opened the website before, I want no welcome DM, so that only newcomers are nudged.
48. As a workspace maintainer, I want to turn the welcome nudge off in App Home settings, so that the workspace decides whether HedgeHug may DM first.
49. As a new member who just turned my welcome item, I want one line that tells me how the next item comes, so that I learn the loop in one sentence.

**Share and the Monday post (stopping point 5)**

50. As a member who just found an epic or legendary hoggie or completed a team page, I want a `Share` button, so that I can show the win to my workspace.
51. As a member, I want sharing to happen only when I press it, once per win, so that nothing is posted in my name by surprise.
52. As a colleague, I want a shared win to lead with the thanks behind it, so that the post celebrates the thanks, not the loot.
53. As a member thanked in a private channel, I want a shared win never to quote the message, so that private thanks stay private.
54. As a member of a workspace without a weekly-post channel, I want no `Share` button, so that I never press something that cannot post.
55. As a reader of the Monday post, I want a quoted kudos to say which epic or legendary hoggie it brought once its owner has turned it, so that the post shows the fun without spoiling anyone.

**Pet hoggie (stopping point 6)**

56. As a member, I want to pick one hoggie I own as my pet, so that my page shows something I chose.
57. As a member, I want to change my pet at any time, so that it follows my favourite.
58. As a colleague, I want to see a member's pet in colour on their person page and beside their sticker on team pages, so that the album feels personal.

**Achievement hoggies (stopping point 7)**

59. As a member who fills a team page or reaches a milestone tier, I want a hoggie I do not own yet, rarer the harder the achievement, so that a hard achievement pays better than an easy one and never pays a duplicate.

**Onboarding (stopping point 8)**

60. As a newcomer at the end of my first visit, I want one card that shows a hug and a kudos as they look in Slack, so that I know the two gestures before I leave.
61. As a newcomer, I want the card to tell me that my first kudos takes me to level 2 and what level 2 unlocks, so that I have a reason to try it now.
62. As a newcomer, I want `Try it in Slack` to open my workspace, so that trying it is one click.
63. As a member, I want the card once and never again after I close it, and never once I have given a kudos, so that it never nags me.
64. As a newcomer, I want my first kudos, thoughtful or not, to take me straight to level 2 in Slack, so that the first level-up follows the first thanks.
65. As a member who reaches level 2, I want `:raised_hands:` to work as my kudos emoji does, in a message and as a reaction, with nothing to upload, so that I can use what I unlocked at once.
66. As a member already at level 2 or above when this ships, I want `:raised_hands:` too, with its unlock shown once on my next visit, so that nobody is left behind.
67. As a member, I want the level-up takeover to name the emoji it unlocked and how to use it, so that I know what to do with it.
68. As a newcomer who just gave my first hug, I want one private reply that says what it did and how to earn an item, so that I learn the next step from my own action.
69. As a member, I want the emoji popup to lead with the emojis I can use now, the kudos emoji first, so that I am never frustrated by a list of locked ones.
70. As a member, I want the next three emojis I can unlock, nearest first, with how to earn each, so that I know what to aim for.
71. As a member with an earned emoji Slack does not have yet, I want `Set it up` beside it, so that I can make it usable.
72. As a member, I want the emoji button's count to be the emojis I can use, so that a newcomer sees 1, not 0 of 27.
73. As a newcomer, I want `Getting started` to walk the loop (a hug, a thoughtful kudos, a turn, level 2) with one line on how to do the next step, so that I always know what comes next.
74. As the product owner, I want to know whether a closed card was closed with `Try it in Slack`, so that I can see whether the card sends people to Slack.

**Link previews (stopping point 9)**

75. As a member, I want a person or team link I paste into Slack to unfold into a card, so that showing off my page or a teammate's looks as good as a shared video.
76. As a member, I want a `Share` button on every person and team page that copies its link, so that I can paste it into Slack without hunting for the address.

**Rich link cards (stopping point 10)**

77. As a member, I want my link's card to show my level, my rarest hoggies and my best stats, so that pasting it in Slack is worth bragging with.
78. As a member, I want a team link's card to show how the team is doing, so that a team can show off together.

**Weekly highlights (stopping point 11)**

79. As a reader of the Monday post, I want one top kudos and the week's top three new givers, the first with their card, so that people who just started thanking get noticed without the post getting long.

## Implementation Decisions

### Vocabulary

- **LP1 The lexicon.** The first ticket declares and widens these terms in `lexicon.json`, before any spec uses them:
  - **item** widens: something a member owns or has waiting. Besides a kudos emoji or hedgehog with a stable ID (its sense today), an item is a reward the member has not seen, a thanked person's sticker or a hoggie, that lies face down on the item board until its turn. **hoggie** changes with it: a hoggie waits as an item and is drawn at its turn, not at an open.
  - **item board**: the one place on the website where every waiting item lies face down. It is declared as "item board", not "board", because "board" is the leaderboard's ranking.
  - **face down**: an item not yet turned, which shows nothing of what it holds.
  - **turn**: the member's click that reveals one item and puts it in the album. An item turns once.
  - **last visit**: one instant per member, stored on the server, moved forward once per visit.
  - **XP moment**: what plays when a member comes back: the excerpts since the last visit, their XP into the bar, a level-up takeover when a level was crossed, then the waiting items.
  - **teaser**, **norm line**, **share**, **welcome nudge**, **welcome item**, **pet hoggie**, as Silthus/personal#100 defined them: a teaser is a line in a Slack surface the member opens or already receives that counts what waits and never says what it holds; a norm line is a count of people who gave thoughtful kudos in a period, with no names; a share is a member's own press that posts one win to the weekly-post channel; the welcome nudge is the one DM a member gets after receiving a kudos or hug while they have never opened the website; the welcome item is a member's first hoggie, with a rare floor, waiting for their first visit; the pet hoggie is the one hoggie a member picks to show on their person page and on team pages.

### The items ledger

- **LP2 A new Items module.** `convex/items` owns every reward a member has not seen, with its own component spec. It keeps a ledger with one row per waiting item, written in the same mutation that earns it (ADR-0010, carried from the architecture branch into `docs/adr/` by the first ticket, with `docs/architecture/items.md`).
- **LP3 Two sources.** An item is a sticker or a hoggie. Earned emojis are never items and never hidden: each unlocks with the turn that brings it (LP14). There are no random emojis (LP15). This overrides the architecture's emoji source.
- **LP4 The ledger's shape** (from the architecture prototype, trimmed to the two sources):

  ```ts
  source: "sticker" | "hoggie"
  key: string // sticker: the pack ID; hoggie: the crate key (thoughtful:<pack>, level:<n>:<slot>, welcome:first, team:<team>, milestone:<milestone>:<tier>)
  floor?: Rarity // a level-up's third hoggie (rare), the welcome item (rare), a team or tier item (LP62)
  reason: { kind: "thanks"; person; message } | { kind: "levelUp"; level } | { kind: "welcome" } | { kind: "team"; team; name } | { kind: "milestone"; milestone; tier }
  earnedAt: number
  turnedAt?: number
  // indexes: by_member_turned [member, turnedAt, earnedAt]; by_member_source_key [member, source, key]
  ```

- **LP5 Earned once, turned once.** An item is unique per member, source and key: a second earn returns the first row and changes nothing, so redelivered events, retried pages and the backfill can overlap. `turnedAt` is set once and never moves.
- **LP6 Earned whatever the flag says.** Writers earn items whether or not `hidden-items` is on for the member, as packs are recorded whatever `album` says (ADR-0006, ADR-0009). The old reveals (open and put-in, the level-up drop) mark their items turned, so a member whose flag turns on finds exactly what they have not seen, and a flag turned back off loses nothing.
- **LP7 Who earns.** The thoughtful pack grant earns the hoggie (`thoughtful:<pack>`) and, where the grant decided the pack holds one, the person's sticker, both with reason `thanks`. A thanks therefore earns one or two items. The level-up hoggie drop earns `level:<n>:<slot>` for its three slots, the third with a rare floor, and drops nothing while `hidden-items` is on. The welcome item is LP44. The team and tier items are LP62.
- **LP8 Reads are one range each.** The board reads one index range, oldest first, at most 100 items with a `more` flag. The waiting count reads one range of at most 51 rows and answers "50+" past 50.
- **LP9 The board names nothing.** A board item carries its ID, when it was earned and its reason (the thanked person's name and face, or the level). Never a face, a person's sticker, a hoggie, a rarity or a source.

### The turn

- **LP10 One turn mutation.** `turnItem` is the only thing that reveals an item and puts it in the album. It answers the face, the page it lands on, the XP it applied and anything it unlocked, or `refused` for another member's item, a missing item, or `album` or `hidden-items` off, writing nothing then.
- **LP11 Drawn at the turn.** A hoggie item has no drop record until its turn. The turn draws it (the draw stays a pure function of the secret, the member, the crate key and the catalogue version), counts the find, records the crest and pays the crate's band through the existing gain path: 15 XP for a thoughtful pack, nothing for a level-up or the welcome item. Hoggies' drop takes `waits` from its caller instead of checking the crate kind; the old open passes `waits: true`.
- **LP12 Idempotent.** A replayed turn answers the same face with `again: true`, applies nothing and publishes nothing, because the Convex client resends a mutation after a reconnect. Two tabs turning two items at once both succeed; Convex retries one on conflict.
- **LP13 A sticker's turn is today's put-in.** It records the pack sticker, counts the new face, publishes `stickerPutIn` (so `album sticker collected` keeps its series) and lands on the member's first team page holding the person, else the people page. Milestones stay inline: every turn, a sticker's or a hoggie's, records the milestone tiers it reaches in the same mutation and answers them, so their unlock plays in the turn's sequence. This drops the architecture's move of milestones to the bus.
- **LP14 Emojis unlock with the turn that brings them.** Every emoji is unlocked by an item or a milestone, so its unlock plays as a follow-up of the turn whose item brings it, after the item lands: a sticker that fills the last place on a team unlocks the team sticker and its team emoji on that team page (LP19); a turn that reaches a collection milestone tier (people, teams, reach, hoggies) unlocks the tier and its emoji on Milestones (LP19a); the first item turned from thanking a person unlocks that person's hype emoji beside their sticker. Emojis earned away from the board unlock where the member next sees their cause: a level's emoji in the level-up takeover (LP34), and a thoughtful-giving tier, reached in Slack, as a follow-up of the member's next turn. Each unlock plays once, wherever it plays first, and marks its emoji seen. None of them is an item, and nothing lands in the top bar.
- **LP15 No random emojis.** Random emoji drops never left the sandbox (`random-emojis` is sandbox-only), and the core loop has none: the turn never rolls one. The sandbox's old open keeps its roll until the tray retires.
- **LP16 Analytics.** The first turn of an item publishes `itemTurned` on the bus, projected as `item turned` with `source`, `rarity` and `is_new` on the allowlist. The dark-features walk reaches it.

### The board on the website

- **LP17 Where it shows.** While `hidden-items` is on, `getAlbum` answers the board and empty packs and tray. The board opens over the live album shell when items wait and the XP moment (if any) has handed over. "Later" closes it, and an "N items wait" pill under the top bar opens it again; while `xp-moments` is on, the glow beside the level bar takes the pill's place (LP61). The packs button and the tray are hidden.
- **LP18 The Page-first sequence at 0.8×.** The prototype's accepted timings, one hoggie, measured: the click at 0 s, the page cross-fades from 0.03 s and shows at 0.36 s, the turn starts at 0.76 s with the rarity bursting partway through, the hold with the caption from 1.7 s, the fade-and-jump to the slot from 2.5 to 2.8 s, the drop from 3.1 s, then a rest, and the board is back at 5.3 s. A plain item takes about 5.8 s from click to board; one that also unlocks a team sticker about 8.8 s. The decision-rich part of `play()` (prototype durations at 1×; the real build divides each by 0.8):

  ```ts
  lift to the middle (560 ms) ‖ if another page: aside, 200 ms, go to the item's page
  turn: rotateY 0 → 205° → 180° (720 ms), burst at 330 ms
  hold with caption; +15 XP chip flies to the bar; 650 ms
  fade to the slot: dark, 220 ms, jump (never scroll), light, 260 ms
  above the slot (420 ms), drop (190 ms, fast-in), disc fits the slot
  land: slot pops 1 → 1.26 → 0.93 → 1.04 → 1 (520 ms), two rings, squash 1.16 × 0.84 (200 ms)
  if the sticker filled a team: 380 ms, fade to the seal, gold burst, seal pops and colours (760 ms), 1300 ms
  then each milestone tier the turn reached (LP19a)
  rest 800 ms, the board comes back (420 ms)
  ```

- **LP19 What the sequence holds.** Hover never changes the page and never says where an item belongs: the item lifts 9 px, wiggles once and its question mark bobs, and nothing loops. A hoggie's page opens at the top of the `Hoggies` page, so its rarity waits for the turn. The burst carries the rarity: the hoggie's rarity colour, the accent colour for a sticker. On the drop a sticker's disc squares off to the slot's corners, and a hoggie loses its disc so only the art lands. A filled team's sticker unlocks with a gold burst, the seal pops and colours in, it reads `Unlocked <date> :team-…:` and gets a "New" label, with no second line under it. The turned item's caption is its name and one line.
- **LP19a A milestone gets its own beat.** After the item lands (and after a team sticker's unlock), each tier the turn reached plays on Milestones: the screen fades to the medal (never a scroll), the medal pops from grey into its tier's colour with a burst of rays in that colour, its name and tier read out (`Familiar faces · Silver`), and its emoji pops in beside it with a "New" label. It holds about 1.5 s at 0.8×, longer than a team sticker's unlock, and a click skips it like the rest. A diamond tier adds the gold confetti. Reduced motion shows the medal and emoji in place with one line.
- **LP20 The board's look.** Every back is the same cream disc with a dashed orange ring and an orange question mark. The items drift in a loose cluster with mixed sizes and tilts and no panel behind them. The only text is "N items wait" and a quiet "Later". The first item sits a little forward, and a pointer slides in and taps it twice, then stops, and disappears once the member hovers or clicks. Items with reason `levelUp` carry a gold "Level N" tag.
- **LP21 Skip, reduced motion and phone.** A click anywhere, or `Enter`, `Space` or `Esc`, jumps the running item into its slot. With reduced motion, a click puts the item in place, shows its slot, says what it was ("70's Dance: Rare hoggie · New") and adds the XP, with no movement. A phone runs the same flow with 72 px items.
- **LP22 "New" labels.** Every sticker, hoggie plate, team sticker and medal turned or unlocked after the member's last visit carries a small "New" label on its page. The labels clear at the member's next visit (LP26): an item put in before that visit never says New again, even when the last visit stops short of it.

### The old flow goes dark

- **LP23 The tray and the put-in.** While `hidden-items` is on, the website's open, put-in and put-all-in refuse, and their code stays until the flag is everyone's. A tray item not yet put in is a face-down item; its turn finishes today's put-in without a second XP. A hoggie in the tray turns from its existing drop and pays nothing.
- **LP24 The backfill.** `fillItems`, internal and run by hand once per deployment, again after the flag widens and again after it goes back off, walks every member one mutation at a time and earns, idempotently, every pack not yet opened (its sticker where it holds one, and its hoggie) and every tray item not yet put in. Level-up hoggies already dropped earn nothing. For a member whose `hidden-items` is off while the old level-up drop is on (`level-up-reveal`), it drops every level item still waiting through that drop, whichever flag kept it waiting, which marks it turned, so the level's hoggies reach the old reveal once and pay nothing. Nothing stored is deleted, and a rerun earns nothing twice.
- **LP25 The Slack reply and the level-up reveal.** While `hidden-items` is on for the giver, each recipient's headline is "An item for thanking X" (for `nextWeek`: "Kudos counted." and "Your next item for X comes next week."), with one line "N wait" (or "50+ wait") and one button, "See your items", to the item board. The headline stays "An item" when the thanks earned a sticker too, so the count per thanks never tells a new face. No outcome lines and no hype picture: the new person, page progress and emoji unlock move to the turn. Feedback reads only Items' waiting count. The separate level-up reveal page from Silthus/kudos#744, which turns three cards face up, is not shown while `hidden-items` is on, and the level-up DM's link opens the album instead. The level-up lives in the one flowing sequence: the XP flies in, the takeover follows (LP34), and it flows into the item board, where the level's three items wait face down (LP32).

### Last visit and the XP moment

- **LP26 The last visit.** One forward-only instant per member, kept in Website reads. It moves once per visit: at the XP moment's end or skip when one plays, and at arrival when none plays (flag off, or nothing since). A moment the member starts from the glow (LP61) moves it again at its own end or skip. It moves to the newest instant the moment read, never to the clock, so entries decided while the moment played wait for the next one, and a stale tab moves nothing. The visit's answer labels from the later of the last visit and the newest item put in, so what a visit turned after its moment ended never says New at the next visit; a stale tab's answer is the last visit as it stands. It exists under `hidden-items` (for the "New" labels) and under `xp-moments`, whichever is on.
- **LP27 What it reads.** `getXpMoment` reads Activity through a new lower bound, `activitySince`: one index range per source with the instant above the last visit, at most 50 entries, plus the waiting count. It answers `off`, `none` (no last visit yet, or nothing since) or a moment: the excerpts, the fold, the climb from the standing before the moment's XP to now, and the waiting items. The pack's 15 XP is not in it: that pays at the turn.
- **LP28 Which excerpts.** Kudos received, hugs on the member's message, kudos the member gave, hugs the member gave and level-ups. Up to five: every level-up crossed, then the newest of the rest, shown oldest first. Everything else folds into one line, "+12 more kudos and hugs · +140 XP", whose XP flies as one chip.
- **LP29 The canvas.** After a 600 ms settle the page dims under the top bar; the XP bar stays lit while the rest of the top bar fades back. Senders show initials on a colour; only HedgeHug's own messages carry the sitting hedgehog.
- **LP30 The mystery orb.** The excerpts and the fold line fly out of a glowing orb in the centre, 170 ms apart, and ring it: 370 by 196 px on desktop, tilted up to 7°, overlapping a little, each with its own "+N XP" chip. The orb reads "? XP · Tap to collect" with a countdown ring.
- **LP31 Collect.** A click anywhere collects, or the timeout: 2 s plus 0.7 s per excerpt (6.2 s for six). Each excerpt dissolves left to right into fine dust and XP particles, 140 ms apart over a 720 ms sweep; the particles fly into the orb, which counts up from +0 to the total with a small bump as they land. After a 550 ms beat the orb streams into the XP bar, which fills particle by particle; crossing a level pops the level pill.
- **LP32 One flowing sequence.** The XP moment, the level-up takeover and the item board are one sequence on one dim canvas, each flowing into the next. After the XP lands (and the takeover, when a level was crossed), the canvas reads "+178 XP from 16 moments since Mon 09:12" and becomes the item board: the round face-down items land on it, the level's new items among them with their gold `Level N` tag, and a click turns one right there (LP18). "Later" is a quiet link. The norm line sits under the summary (LP40).
- **LP33 Skip, reduced motion, quiet weeks, phone.** `Skip` and `Esc` land all the XP at once and show the end state. Reduced motion shows the end state at once. With no excerpts, only the items show; with no excerpts and no items, nothing plays. Rays and confetti run once. On a phone the orb sits under the excerpts; the accepted sequence was checked at desktop size only, so the slice's proof checks the phone layout.
- **LP34 The level-up takeover.** When the climb crosses a level, after the bar fills, gold sparks fly off the level pill and a gold `Level N` disc drops to the centre with a shockwave, one pass of gold rays and gold confetti. "You reached level N!", then the unlocks pop in one by one: "3 new items unlocked" with three face-down backs, and the level's emoji where the level earns one, which says how to use it while `onboarding` is on (LP72). Then "Level N+1 is X XP away". It stays until the member clicks, and the click flows into the item board, where those three backs land among the waiting items (LP32). The skill point and the level emblem the prototype listed are left out: skill points are retired, and a level emblem is not a thing the album has or needs.
- **LP35 One moment per visit.** A second tab or device reads the same moment until one of them ends it; ending an older moment moves nothing.
- **LP36 Analytics.** `endXpMoment` records `xp moment ended` as a usage fact with `skipped`, `excerpts_shown` and `folded`.
- **LP61 The glow beside the level bar.** While `xp-moments` is on, what the moment would have played and did not (after Later, a dismissal, or a tab left open while kudos came in) glows beside the level bar, and nothing else does: `Collect XP` while `getXpMoment` answers a moment this tab has not played, else LP17's "N items wait", in the pill's place, so one control starts both. A press plays that read's moment as the same flowing sequence (LP28–LP34), then the waiting items; its end moves the last visit as LP26 says, so a stale tab moves nothing and a collected moment never glows again. With nothing waiting there is no glow, and with `xp-moments` off the top bar is as before. On a phone it sits at the end of the level row. Its pulse runs twice and rests on a still glow (VA25); under reduced motion it is still, and a press shows the end state at once (LP33).
- **LP37 Types from the server.** The website imports every new answer type (board, turn, XP moment) from `convex/website`; it adds no hand copies.

### Teaser and norm line

- **LP38 The teaser.** "3 items wait · 2 kudos came in since your last visit" sits at the top of App Home's front door, under the level line, and is the last count line of the Monday hugs recap. The counts are the waiting items (LP8, "50+") and the kudos received since the last visit (one range, "50+"). Without a last visit the kudos half is left out. The line is hidden when both are zero. It never says what an item holds.
- **LP39 No new digest.** The hugs recap still goes out only in weeks with hugs, to members who get it by DM. There is no album digest DM.
- **LP40 The norm line.** "N teammates gave thoughtful kudos this week" closes the XP moment and sits on App Home's front door. N counts the workspace's distinct thoughtful givers this giving week, members opted out of the boards included, and names nobody. It is hidden below 3. It is a count of people, never an average. A stored count per workspace and giving week, bumped on a member's first thoughtful kudos of the week, keeps the read to one row. The Monday post keeps its own "N people gave kudos last week" line.
- **LP41 Flags.** The teaser shows where `teasers` and `hidden-items` are both on for the member; the App Home norm line where `teasers` is on; the XP moment's norm line where `xp-moments` is on.
- **LP42 Reactive only.** The teaser and the norm line live only in surfaces the member opens or already receives. Neither sends a new message.
- **LP43 Words.** Slack copy says "album" (not "Team Album") and lowercase "hoggie".

### Welcome

- **LP44 The welcome item.** A member who has never opened the website (no signed-in user for their Slack identity) has exactly one welcome item: a hoggie item with key `welcome:first` (the `welcome` crate kind, which has no pack band), reason `welcome`, a rare floor and no XP. It is earned when the welcome nudge is sent, and at the member's first sign-in if it is still missing. A member who signed in before `welcome-item` ships earns none. It never expires.
- **LP45 The welcome nudge.** Right after a kudos or hug the member receives, while they have never opened the website, HedgeHug sends one DM. It is sent at most once per member, ever, recorded before the send so a retry never sends twice. Members thanked before launch are reached on their next kudos or hug.
- **LP46 Its copy.** The giver and the quoted thanks, then "Your rare hoggie is waiting for you to collect it.", then a button, "Open your HedgeHug album". For a hug the first line reads `Alex hugged your message :hedgehog:`, linking the hugged message. It never says "face down" or "item waits" and shows no XP. "Rare" is the welcome item's one exception to no spoilers, and the rare floor makes it always true; the nudge never names or shows the hoggie. A kudos from a private channel is named without a quote.
- **LP47 Only newcomers.** A member who has opened the website gets no nudge, only the teaser.
- **LP48 The maintainer's switch.** The workspace maintainer can turn the welcome nudge off in App Home settings. Members have no setting of their own.
- **LP49 Teaching the loop.** While `onboarding` is off, after the welcome item turns, one line on the board teaches the loop: "Your next item comes when you thank a teammate with :hedgehog: and say why.", with the workspace's kudos emoji. While `onboarding` is on, the how-it-works card (LP67) takes the line's place, and it is the only tutorial. Where LP67 answers no card, the line shows as before.
- **LP50 Flag.** All of LP44–LP49 is behind `welcome-item`, read for the receiving member, and needs `hidden-items` on for them too.

### Share and the Monday post

- **LP51 When Share shows.** Only after a turn that finds an epic or legendary hoggie, or whose sticker completes a team page; diamond tiers wait. It is never on by default and never posts by itself. Without a weekly-post channel there is no button.
- **LP52 Once per win.** A win is shared at most once, keyed by its item, and the button is gone after the press, on every device.
- **LP53 Where it goes.** HedgeHug posts the share into the workspace's weekly-post channel. No channel picker, and no new Slack scope (`chat:write.public` covers public channels).
- **LP54 The card puts the thanks first.** `Michael thanked Alex: '…' and found a legendary Disco Hog`, giver and recipient in bold, or "…and completed the Product Analytics page", with the hoggie art or the team crest and an "Open HedgeHug" link. Colleagues' faces are not shown. The quote is the thanks alone, without the mentions and emoji that open or close the message. A kudos from a private channel names the giver and the recipient without a quote. A level-up hoggie leads with the level (`Michael reached level 7 and found …`) and the welcome item with the find alone.
- **LP55 The Monday post marks a find.** The top-kudos post stays built around the quoted thoughtful kudos. Beside a quote it may show the hoggie the kudos brought ("found a legendary Disco Hog"), only when that item was an epic or legendary hoggie and its owner has turned it. "Team stickers unlocked last week" stays; no list of finds is added. The weekly edition on the website does not get the mark.
- **LP56 Flag.** The share and the Monday post's mark are behind `item-share`; the share also needs `hidden-items` on for the member.

### Pet hoggie

- **LP57 Picking.** "Make my pet" on a hoggie the member owns, on the `Hoggies` page, makes it their pet. One pet per member; picking another replaces it. There is no default pet.
- **LP58 Where it shows.** In colour on the member's person page and beside their sticker on team pages, to every viewer, even one who does not own that hoggie or hold that member's sticker; the sticker itself stays as it is. Not on the Leaderboard and not in Slack.
- **LP59 Storage.** One row per member naming a hoggie slug they own; a pick of a hoggie the member does not own is refused.
- **LP60 Flag.** Behind `pet-hoggie`, read for the viewer for the pet's display and for the owner for "Make my pet".

### Achievement hoggies

- **LP62 Who earns.** A filled team page earns its member one hoggie item keyed `team:<team>`, with reason `team` naming the team and its name and a `rare` floor. Each milestone tier reached earns one keyed `milestone:<milestone>:<tier>`, with reason `milestone` and a floor that rises with the tier: bronze `uncommon`, silver `rare`, gold `epic`, diamond `legendary`. The team sticker's unlock and the tier's record earn them in their own mutation, whatever `hidden-items` or `achievement-hoggies` says (LP6), and the key makes a rerun earn nothing twice (LP5). The `team` and `milestone` crate kinds have no pack band, so their turn pays no XP. Team pages and tiers recorded before this ships earn nothing, and `fillItems` earns none for them (LP24). A workspace that installs later records its history's tiers at install, and those tiers earn their items.
- **LP63 Never a duplicate.** The turn draws a team or tier item from the hoggies at or above its floor that the member does not own at that moment, so a hoggie turned earlier, in the same visit too, counts as owned. The rarity is drawn with the usual weights among the rarities at or above the floor that still hold a hoggie the member does not own. Every other draw keeps its duplicates.
- **LP64 Owning everything at or above the floor.** When the member owns every hoggie at or above the item's floor, the turn draws as any floored item does: a duplicate at or above the floor. A harder achievement therefore never pays a lower rarity than an easier one, which a new hoggie below the floor would.
- **LP65 Flag.** Behind `achievement-hoggies`, read for the member, which also needs `hidden-items` on. While either is off, team and tier items wait unseen: the item board, the waiting count and every reply or teaser built on it leave them out, and the turn refuses them, so today's behaviour is unchanged. Nothing about them is drawn while they wait, so nothing is lost when either flag turns back off: they wait until both are on again. The old flow never paid them, so unlike level items they need no old-flow reveal. On the board a team item carries its team's name and a tier item its medal (`Hoarder · Gold`), as a level item carries its level (LP20). A long tag ends in an ellipsis, and the item's label says it in full.

### Onboarding

- **LP66 The lexicon.** The first ticket of stopping point 8 declares three terms in `lexicon.json` and widens one:
  - **how-it-works card**: the one card that ends a newcomer's first visit and shows a hug and a kudos as they look in Slack.
  - **first-thanks top-up**: the one-off XP that takes a member's first kudos given to level 2.
  - **first-hug reply**: the one ephemeral reply to a member's first hug ever.
  - **earned emoji** widens: level 2 earns one too (LP71).
- **LP67 Who sees the card, and when.** While `onboarding` is on for the member, getAlbum answers the how-it-works card when they have never given a kudos award (one read of their awards as giver) and never closed the card, and answers none otherwise. Nothing else ever shows it. When the welcome item waits face down at arrival, the card opens on the dim canvas in LP49's place, after the welcome item's turn has landed, and closing it hands back to the item board. Otherwise it ends the arrival's sequence. With no XP moment, it opens at arrival. With one, it opens once the moment's XP and any takeover have landed, before the waiting items land, and the items land when it closes. A visit that leaves the welcome item face down shows no card, and the next visit tries again. An existing member who has never given a kudos sees it once, at their next visit after `onboarding` turns on for them. A member who has given one never sees it. There are no coach marks and no tour.
- **LP68 What the card shows.** This is the prototype's card B, with card C's level-2 row under it. The eyebrow reads `How HedgeHug works` and the title `Two ways to thank someone`. Two Slack messages then play in, one after the other, as they look in Slack:
  1. A teammate's message, `Alex Lee`: "Shipped the fix for the flaky deploy, should be green now.". The member's kudos-emoji reaction pops onto it, and the chip `Hug · +1 XP each` follows.
  2. The member's own message, `You`: ":hedgehog: @Alex Lee thanks for staying on the deploy fix, the release went out on time because of you.", with the chips `Kudos · +10 XP` and `said why · +1 item`.

  Under them come "Your first kudos takes you to level 2. Items wait here for you to turn." and one row: `Level 2 unlocks: Leaderboard · 3 items · your next emoji`. For a member already at level 2 or above, the first sentence and the level-2 row are left out, since the top-up pays them nothing. Its buttons are `Try it in Slack` and a quiet `Got it`. The people and words are fixed copy, never a real member's. The emoji is the workspace's kudos emoji with its picture, which getAlbum answers as the welcome item's lesson does. Reduced motion shows the end state with no beats. A phone stacks the two messages full width.
- **LP69 Closing the card.** `Try it in Slack` opens the member's Slack workspace in a new tab, with no channel picked, at the address the existing workspace link builds (`https://app.slack.com/client/<team>`), and closes the card. `Got it` and `Esc` close it too. A close calls `closeHowItWorks` with `triedSlack`, which stores the member's close once and records the usage fact `onboarding card closed` with `tried_slack` on the allowlist. A second close, from a resend or a second tab, stores and records nothing. Once closed, the card never shows again. A visit left without closing the card shows it again at the next visit while LP67 holds.
- **LP70 The first-thanks top-up.** Progression writes the giver's effects record for their first kudos award ever: the award whose record it writes is the giver's oldest award on the awards' giver index. An award an edit adds to that first message later is not the oldest, so it pays nothing. In that mutation, when `onboarding` is on for the giver, it records one reward through recordReward:
  - keyed `first-thanks`, with the kudos message as its cause;
  - no coins, no item, catalogue version `onboarding-1`;
  - paying the XP that takes the giver from their XP after that record to exactly level 2 (20 XP). A giver already at level 2 records nothing.

  The flag is read without an exposure, and only for such a first award. Thoughtful or not, the first kudos counts. The key makes the top-up once per member, so a redelivery or a later recipient page pays nothing more. Recipients get none. A member who gave a kudos before `onboarding` was on for them never gets one: there is no backfill. The crossing publishes one levelReached, so the level-up DM follows as for any level (LP25), and the takeover plays at the next visit (LP72).
- **LP71 Level 2 earns `:raised_hands:`.** While `onboarding` is on for the member, read without an exposure, the level emojis gain level 2 (`level:2`). It is held while the member's level is at or past 2, as every level emoji is. So a member at level 2 or above when the flag turns on holds it at once, and its unlock plays once at their next visit, as any unseen emoji's does.
  - **Its name.** The registry names it the standard Slack emoji `raised_hands`, reserved with the other shared names. This is the one exception to the rule that a slug never takes a standard emoji name. Where the workspace's registry already holds `raised_hands`, or an emoji class classes it, it is named `level-2` and waits for a mapping like any emoji Slack lacks. A registry already in use gets the name from `reserveSharedEmojiNames`, which the first ticket runs for every such workspace at its deploy, sandbox and production alike, so nobody waits for the next company sync. The registry's first-use marker stays level 5's name, so existing registries are still found. It is in Slack and pictured as Slack pictures it through the same rule as every earned emoji, the custom emoji copy first and then Slack's standard emoji, so nothing is uploaded and nothing new reads it.
  - **It counts like the kudos emoji.** Its holder's message that mentions a teammate with `:raised_hands:` is a kudos message, and their 🙌 reaction on a teammate's message is a hug, within the hug budget (Silthus/kudos#746). A skin-toned `:raised_hands:` counts the same, in a message as in a reaction.
  - **The maintainer's mapping.** The emoji wizard counts level 2's holders by level alone, reading the flag only for the maintainer. While `onboarding` is off for the maintainer, the `raised_hands` row shows as Slack's own emoji with no place.
  - **While `onboarding` is off**, nobody holds it, and nothing about it is stored but its reserved name.
- **LP72 The takeover and the XP moment carry it.** While `onboarding` is on, LP34's takeover shows each crossed level's emoji with its picture as `:raised_hands: unlocked`, with the emoji's own name, and one line: "React or thank with it. It counts like :hedgehog:.", with the workspace's kudos emoji. An unlocked emoji Slack lacks, such as `level-2` in a registry where the standard name is taken, gets no how-to line and keeps "New emoji unlocked", by the same "in Slack" rule the emoji button counts with (LP74). While it is off, the takeover reads as before. The XP moment (LP27) adds the first-thanks top-up's XP to the excerpt of the kudos that caused it, with one unique read of the member's `first-thanks` reward. So the orb's total and the bar's climb both start from the member's XP before that kudos. A member who gave their first kudos before they ever visited has no last visit. For them, getXpMoment reads from the instant before that kudos, the `first-thanks` reward's cause, so their first visit plays the moment and its level-2 takeover too. LP26 then moves the last visit as usual.
- **LP73 The first-hug reply.** When the hug's mutation records a member's first hug ever (the hugs' giver index holds no earlier hug of theirs) and `onboarding` is on for them, it schedules their first-hug reply. The flag is read without an exposure, and only for such a first hug. The first hug's own record is the once-marker: no later hug is a first, so nothing else is stored, and Convex runs the scheduled action at most once. Its one try is an ephemeral message in the hugged message's conversation, visible only to them:
  - on an ordinary message, "That was a hug: +1 XP for you and Alex. Thank them in a message and say why to earn an item.", naming the author by the directory's display name, else their real name, else "the author";
  - on a Given kudos message, "That was a hug: +1 XP for you and the people thanked. Thank them in a message and say why to earn an item.".

  It is posted without a thread, since a reaction event carries no thread root. A rate limit holds it as it holds any delivery. Any refusal (the member not in the channel, the channel gone) or an unknown answer skips it silently: there is no retry and no DM fallback, and it is never sent again. It answers the member's own action, so it keeps Silthus/kudos#624 Q14, and it is the one exception to the Hugs rule that a hug sends nothing. A member who hugged before `onboarding` was on gets none.
- **LP74 The emoji popup leads with what the member can use.** While `onboarding` is on, the emoji button counts the emojis the member can use: the kudos emoji, plus every earned emoji they hold that Slack has. That is 1 for a newcomer. The popup opens on three sections:
  - **`Use these now`** lists the workspace's kudos emoji first, with `Your kudos emoji · works from the start`, then every earned emoji the member holds, each with what earned it: the dated ones newest first, then level emojis, highest level first, since they carry no date. One line sits under the heading: "React with any of them or put them in a kudos. Each one counts like :hedgehog:: XP for you both, and an item when you say why." An earned emoji Slack lacks sits there too. Where the mapping wizard opens for that member today, its control reads `Set it up` and opens the wizard. Everyone else keeps today's not-in-Slack control and its words. It is not counted until Slack has it.
  - **`Unlock next`** is LP75.
  - **`All emojis · N`** opens today's shelves, search and `Just unlocked`, unchanged, with a way back. N is the count today's header shows of all.

  While `onboarding` is off, the button and the popup are as today.
- **LP75 Unlock next.** `Unlock next` shows at most three emojis the member does not hold, each with how to earn it and a progress bar, in this order:
  1. The level-2 emoji, while they do not hold it: "Reach level 2 · your first kudos does it".
  2. Until they hold their first hype emoji, one generic row: "Thank someone and say why: unlock their hype emoji". Hype emojis are never listed one by one.
  3. The rest, by the share of their progress done, highest first, ties in the shelves' order.

  With nothing left to earn, the section is gone.
- **LP76 `Getting started` follows the loop.** While `onboarding` is on, getAlbum answers `Getting started`. Its four steps, in order, are each done from one read:
  1. `Give a hug`: a hug the member gave.
  2. `Give a thoughtful kudos`: a thoughtful kudos award they gave, from their all-time thoughtful tally.
  3. `Turn an item`: an item of theirs turned.
  4. `Reach level 2`: their level is at or past 2.

  The profile shows `Getting started · N of 4`, a mark per step, and the first step not done with one line on how, with the workspace's kudos emoji:
  - "Next: Give a hug · react with :hedgehog: on any message in Slack"
  - "Next: Give a thoughtful kudos · thank a teammate with :hedgehog: in a message and say why"
  - "Next: Turn an item · turn a waiting item on your board"
  - "Next: Reach level 2 · your first kudos takes you there"

  Once all four are done, it is gone. These steps replace the old four (a hug, a thoughtful kudos, opening a pack, completing a team page), which no live answer filled. While `onboarding` is off, getAlbum answers none, as today, so nothing shows.
- **LP77 Flag.** All of LP67–LP76 is behind `onboarding`. It is read without an exposure for the member it concerns: the visitor for the card, the popup and `Getting started`; the giver for the top-up and the first-hug reply; the holder for the level-2 emoji. It also needs `hidden-items` on for them, as `welcome-item` does (LP50). The first ticket creates it. The conductor widens it to 100% in production once every ticket's sandbox proof is green, with an annotation, and no ticket widens it. While it is off for a member, everything is as before: LP49's line, today's popup and count, no `Getting started`, no top-up, no first-hug reply and no level-2 emoji. Turning it off loses nothing earned: the top-up's XP and the card's close stay recorded, and the level-2 emoji comes back with the flag.

### Link previews

- **LP78 What unfolds.** A link to a person page (`/book#people/<member id>`) or a team page (`/book#teams/<team slug>`) on the website's own origin, pasted into Slack by anyone, unfolds through Slack's app unfurls: the `link_shared` event, `chat.unfurl` with Block Kit, the `links:read` and `links:write` scopes and the website's host under `unfurl_domains`. Several links in one message unfold in one call, once the message is posted. A redelivered event unfolds once. A rate-limited call waits as Slack asks and tries again, three attempts in all; any other refusal is logged by its code. Unfolds start once the app is reinstalled with the new scopes and event.
- **LP79 The cards.** A person's card: their face (the company profile's, else their Slack picture), their name linked to the page, a line with their level and their teams, and a line with their best four medals, as the profile card reads them (PC9). A team's card: its posthog.com crest picture where it has one, its name linked to the page, and how many people it has. A context line names the album and the kind of page. Names are escaped and the text is read verbatim, so no name links, mentions or notifies anyone.
- **LP80 Only HedgeHug's person and team pages.** Another site, any other album place, a team nobody has, an ID that isn't a member's, a bot and a member of another workspace get no card, a link shared in a workspace other than the website's gets none, a link still in the composer gets none (Slack doesn't say yet where it goes), and a link posted in a channel shared with another organization gets none, since people outside the workspace would read the card. Where Slack's event doesn't say whether the channel is shared, the app asks `conversations.info` and unfolds only in a channel it reports as neither shared nor pending; no answer means no card. Links that get no card leave the rest of the message's links to unfold.
- **LP81 What a card may show.** Only what the page shows every signed-in member, and the same to every reader whoever shared it: never the counts between the sharer and the person, never XP, kudos or hug totals, and never a team's held-of-total, which is each reader's own album. Medals follow what has shipped, read for no viewer. LP86 widens this while `rich-link-cards` is on.
- **LP82 Flag.** Unfolds and `Share` are behind `link-previews`, read without an exposure: for the sharer for an unfold (the workspace decision for a sharer the directory doesn't know yet) and for the visitor for `Share`. While it is off, a link gets no card and the app makes no Slack call, and no page has `Share`. It needs no other core-loop flag.
- **LP83 Share.** Every person page, every team page and the member's own page carry `Share`. It copies the page's canonical URL (Silthus/personal#134) and says `Link copied. Paste it in Slack to show … card.`. Where the browser refuses the clipboard it shows the link in a field to copy by hand. There is no `Post to Slack`: pasting the link is what unfolds it.

### Rich link cards

- **LP84 The person card.** While `rich-link-cards` is on, a person's card adds to LP79: their teams right under their name, each led by its team emoji (`:team-<slug>:`) where the workspace's Slack has it and named alone otherwise; `Level <n> → <n+1>` on its own line and under it a slim bar of ten segments (`▰`, `▱`) filled for the share of the way to the next level, narrow enough to stay on one line beside the picture; the stats as fields, each with an emoji: their place on the all-time leaderboard, the thoughtful kudos they have given, the hoggies they have found of the catalogue, the people in their album and the emojis they have unlocked; and a line of their rarest hoggies' pictures, rarest first, up to nine, led by the rarest's name and its rarity as a word, with no coloured square. A stat at zero is left out, never boasted. A person with no stat and no hoggie gets a friendly line instead. The context line adds the day its facts were read, in each reader's own time zone, since Slack keeps a card as it was posted.
- **LP85 The team card.** While `rich-link-cards` is on, a team's card adds to LP79: LP84's slim bar of the share of its people who have given a thoughtful kudos, with `<n> of <m> have said thanks`; its place on the all-time team leaderboard and its thoughtful kudos given; and its people's rarest hoggies the same way as LP84. One message reads the hoggies of at most 20 people across its cards, link by link, so it stays within Convex's limits, and a card past that shows hoggies only from the people already read. A team with none of these gets a friendly line instead.
- **LP86 Where each fact comes from.** The card shows the same to every reader whoever shared it, and never names the counts between the sharer and the person, XP, kudos received or hugs. The place and the thoughtful kudos are the all-time Leaderboard's, which every member sees, so a member off the boards shows neither, and a team counts only its people on the boards. The level bar, the hoggies found, the rarest hoggies and the people in the album are the person's own page (Silthus/personal#134), as its owner sees it: the product owner asked for them on the card (Silthus/personal#145). The teams are the person page's, from the company profile the person is matched to, so a person whose posthog.com profile is on no team page shows none. The emojis unlocked are the album's own earned count, as its Emojis tab counts it for its owner: team stickers, the hype emojis the album shows (unseen first, at most 200), milestone and level emojis, each only once the workspace has named it and held back while its item waits face down, and the random drops whose Slack emoji is still there while `random-emojis` is on for the person; the product owner asked for it (Silthus/personal#155). Each person card's emojis are counted in a read of their own, apart from the card's other facts, so the count stays within Convex's limits beside the all-time Leaderboard's read. Hoggies show only while `collection` is on for the person, and the level only while XP levels show in the workspace.
- **LP87 Pictures Slack can fetch.** Every hoggie's picture is a PNG the website serves at a stable public address (`/share/<hoggie>.png`), as the share's card (LP54) already does for epic and legendary ones.
- **LP88 Flag.** `rich-link-cards` is read without an exposure for the same subject as `link-previews` (LP82). While it is off, every card is LP79's, byte for byte. It needs `link-previews` and no other core-loop flag.

### Weekly highlights

- **LP89 One top kudos.** While `weekly-highlights` applies, the top-kudos Monday post quotes only the first kudos of its ranking (the most hugs, then the most recipients, then the latest). It carries no place: it is simply last week's top kudos. Its giver and recipients are linked to their person pages, and its `Open in Slack` permalink is left for Slack to embed: the post goes with `unfurl_links: true`, so Slack shows its own preview of the quoted message, which people can click through. Our own links get no card from it, since a bot's post is no member's share (LP78), and `unfurl_media` stays off. The product owner asked for it after the first sandbox post. The team stickers unlocked last week stay as they are.
- **LP90 The top three new givers.** Under the quote, `🌱 Top new givers last week` lists up to three members, each on one line: their place, their name linked to their person page, and the thoughtful kudos they gave that week. The count is the Leaderboard's for last week (the thoughtful board's week tally), so it matches the website's `Last week` board. They are ranked by that count, and a tie goes to the giver the board started counting first that week. A member listed in an earlier week's post in the workspace is never listed again, and a member off the boards (`Show me on the leaderboards` off) never is. Fewer left are listed as they are, and none leaves the section out. It names only these three and their counts, never a full ranking. The mutation that claims the week records who it lists and in what order, so a retried post lists the same people and a later week skips them, while a post Slack refuses for its channel records nobody. Givers listed before never count against how many givers a post checks. The product owner asked for it (Silthus/personal#156), and the "new" rule lives in one place.
- **LP91 The first new giver's card.** The first new giver gets LP84's rich person card, rendered into the post's own blocks right under their line. Second and third stay plain links. Slack unfolds only the quoted message (LP89), so only one card shows. The card is read in a query of its own after the claim, so the claim's reads don't grow. A post Slack refuses for its blocks goes once more without the card or the team pictures.
- **LP92 Flag.** All of LP89–LP91 is behind `weekly-highlights`, read in the workspace decision without an exposure. It needs `album-slack`, which makes the post the top-kudos post, and no core-loop flag. While it is off, the post is byte for byte as before and nobody is recorded as listed.

### Person page D

- **LP93 One page for you and a teammate.** While `person-page-d` is on for the viewer, `#me` and `#people/<id>`, their own ID included, show the prototype's design D (Silthus/personal#161): the card, the rarest find, the week and, on a teammate's page, `You and <name>`. Their own page has no `Your page` heading, keeps today's own hype emoji pick below the week while it is offered, and links `Find your team` in place of a team until they are matched; a teammate's card keeps `Teammate · in your album` (or `not in your album yet`, with how to collect them).
- **LP94 The card's facts.** One model, `getPlayerCard`, answers the same card to every viewer and is what the share image reads: the face, the name, the first team, the level and XP while XP levels show in the workspace, this week's place and thoughtful kudos from the week's Leaderboard (none while the person is off the boards or has given none this week), the people in their album with the newest three faces, the hoggies found and the rarest find while `collection` is on for them, and their medals with the best three. The emojis unlocked are LP86's count with its first four pictures, read in a query of their own, `getPlayerCardEmojis`. Only the owner's card says how much XP is left to the next level.
- **LP95 A teammate's week.** Activity stays private to its member. A teammate's page shows their week's day bars and totals (thanked, thanked by, packs opened and hugs) and their kudos of the week only when it is a public thoughtful kudos, by the rule the weekly post uses. Only the owner sees the latest kudos lines and the way to `Activity`.
- **LP96 Where the stats lead.** On the owner's page each stat and the rarest find lead to the page behind them, except the emojis, whose list is the top bar's emoji popover. A teammate's stats and rarest find are not links, since those pages show the viewer's own album.
- **LP97 A quiet member.** A member with no hoggie, person, emoji or medal yet shows a welcome line in place of the stats, never a row of zeros; no place, no hoggie and a quiet week each say so in words.
- **LP98 Flag.** All of LP93–LP97 is behind `person-page-d`, read for the viewer without an exposure. While it is off, both pages are as before. It depends on no core-loop flag.

### Card picture

- **LP99 The picture.** While `card-image` is on, a person link unfolds into a 1200×630 PNG of their player card, drawn dark from LP94's model as a teammate's page D shows it: the level ring around their face, with their level on it; their name, their first team with its crest, and their XP with their level; the place strip with this week's place and thoughtful kudos, or that they are not on this week's board yet; four stats in four shapes: the hoggies found of the catalogue with a bar while `collection` is on for them, then the people in their album beside the newest three faces, the emojis they have unlocked beside the first four, and their medals beside the best three; and beside the card, their rarest find with its rarity as a word and the day they found it. The people stat shows how many they hold without the album's total. A member LP97 calls quiet gets its welcome line in place of the four shapes, never a row of zeros. A face, crest, emoji or hoggie that can't be fetched gives way to initials or an empty shape, never a failed picture.
- **LP100 The unfold.** The unfold is the picture as an image block, with alt text that carries every fact it shows, and one context line: the name linked to the page, the album and `as of` the day its facts were read (LP84). A team link keeps LP85's card.
- **LP101 Drawn once per card.** The picture is kept in Convex file storage, keyed by a hash of the card's facts and the drawing's version, so an unchanged card is never drawn again and a changed one gets a new picture under a new key. Its storage URL is unguessable, not secret: anyone holding the URL sees the picture, as with any image Slack fetches. It shows only what LP94's card shows every signed-in member, the same card whoever looks, so it widens LP81 by that card.
- **LP102 The card stands in.** When the picture can't be drawn or stored, or takes more than 5 seconds, the link unfolds into LP84's card. A drawing that finishes late is still kept for the next share.
- **LP103 Flag.** All of LP99–LP102 is behind `card-image`, read in the workspace decision without an exposure. It needs `rich-link-cards`, and it widens only where `person-page-d` is on, since the picture shows that page's card. While it is off, every card is LP84's or LP79's, byte for byte, and nothing is drawn.

### Flags

Eight sandbox-only flags in project 662840, each created with one condition, `environment = sandbox` at 100%, read without an exposure as `album` is, and widened by the conductor once its proof is green: `hidden-items`, `xp-moments`, `teasers`, `welcome-item`, `item-share`, `pet-hoggie`, `achievement-hoggies` and `onboarding`. A ninth, `link-previews` (LP82), is created the same way and widened by its own lane once its proof is green. A tenth, `rich-link-cards` (LP88), is created and widened the same way, and so are an eleventh, `weekly-highlights` (LP92), a twelfth, `person-page-d` (LP98), and a thirteenth, `card-image` (LP103). A missing flag answers off. A recorder never reads a flag.

## Testing Decisions

- **A good test** drives the product from the outside: a signed Slack event or a member's call to a public website function goes in, and what the member sees comes out (the website's answer, the Slack message sent, the App Home published, the PostHog event captured). It never reads a table to prove a behaviour that a member could observe instead.
- **Seam 1: the backend from Slack to the website.** One convex-test backend per test, with the signed Slack boundary, the fake Slack and the fake PostHog from `testing/`, and a signed-in website session calling `getAlbum`, `turnItem`, `getXpMoment` and `endXpMoment`. A thanks in Slack, then the board, the turn and the reply, all through it. Prior art: `convex/website/album.test.ts`, `convex/website/levelUp.test.ts`, `convex/website/activity.test.ts`, the App Home and DM proof seams.
- **Seam 2: the website shell with fixture reads.** The album shell rendered with fixture reads under Testing Library and jsdom, with a fake clock for the sequences, asserting what the member sees and which mutation was called. Prior art: `website/src/album/hoggies.test.tsx`, `levelUp.test.tsx`, `home.test.tsx`, the pack-opening tests.
- **No new seam.** Both seams exist. A ticket that cannot test through them names why in its PR.
- **Idempotence and limits.** The turn's replay, two-tab turns and the ledger's earn-once run through Seam 1 with `transactionLimits: true` where a page of 50 recipients earns items.
- **The flag's two directions.** Each flag gets a test with it off that shows today's behaviour unchanged, and the dark-features walk covers every new event.
- **Onboarding through the same seams.** Seam 1 drives the top-up (a first kudos in Slack, then the level-up DM and getXpMoment's excerpt), the level-2 emoji (a 🙌 reaction and a 🙌 kudos message from a level-2 member), the first-hug reply (the fake Slack's ephemeral, and nothing on a second hug or a refusal), getAlbum's card, popup and `Getting started` answers, and `closeHowItWorks` with its usage fact. Seam 2 renders the card, the popup's sections and `Getting started` from fixture reads. The dark-features walk reaches `onboarding card closed`.
- **Timing and look are proofs, not tests.** The sequences' feel, the phone layout and the reduced-motion path are proven in the sandbox browser with stills or a capture, per ticket.

## Out of Scope

- Quests, the Store and crate store, the quest, feature and bought crates (ADR-0009 retired them), the Book's stickers and Engine.
- Easter-egg items, a glowing next choice, favourite hoggies, a milestone booster and a team-page group quest (ranks 6 to 10 of the game-design research).
- New stat pages: person pair stats, the Leaderboard and the weekly edition stay as they are.
- Any expiry, countdown or loss mechanic, and the welcome item's expiry (revisit once engagement is measured).
- Sound.
- Deleting the tray, the open and the put-in: a follow-up once `hidden-items` is everyone's.
- For onboarding: a tour, coach marks or a second card; a DM fallback or retry for the first-hug reply; a top-up for recipients, or a backfill for members who gave before `onboarding`; a level-2 picture of our own; an XP moment on a first visit for anything but the first-thanks top-up (LP72).
- The architecture's other follow-ups: one earned-emoji set, tallies as bus subscribers, breaking the import cycle between the hoggie, unlock and quest modules, and one guard for album mutations.

## Further Notes

- **Where the product owner's calls override the architecture.** The architecture made earned emojis board items, rolled a random emoji at each pack hoggie's turn and moved milestones to the bus. The product owner ruled that emojis are never hidden but unlock with the turn that brings them, that milestone unlocks get their own beat, and that there are no random emojis, so items are stickers and hoggies only and milestones stay inline in the turn (LP3, LP13, LP14, LP15, LP19a).
- **Choices this spec made** where the inputs left it open: the "New" labels clear at the next visit (LP22); the last visit also moves at arrival when no moment plays (LP26); one headline per thanks, however many items it earned (LP25); level-ups always among the five excerpts (LP28); the separate level-up reveal page gives way to the one flowing sequence (LP25, LP32); a thoughtful-giving tier unlocks after the next turn (LP14); "never opened the website" means no signed-in user (LP44); "item board" rather than "board" in the lexicon (LP1). For onboarding (🤖, where Silthus/personal#133 left it open): a visit that leaves the welcome item face down shows no card, and without a welcome item the card ends the arrival's sequence (LP67); a never-giver at level 2 or above sees the card without its level-2 line and row (LP68); a first visit after a first kudos plays its moment from the top-up's cause (LP72); a skin-toned 🙌 counts (LP71); `Set it up` shows only where the wizard opens (LP74); the card counts as shown once it is closed (LP69); a workspace whose registry already uses `raised_hands` names the level-2 emoji `level-2` (LP71); the takeover's how-to line reads the same for every level emoji Slack has (LP72); the XP moment carries the top-up in its kudos' excerpt (LP72); the first-hug reply goes out without a thread (LP73); the button counts only emojis Slack has (LP74); "nearest" in Unlock next is the share of progress done (LP75).
- **The architecture capture moves into the repo.** `docs/architecture/items.md` and ADR-0010 come from `prototype/items-architecture` with the first ticket, amended for LP3, LP14 and LP15.
